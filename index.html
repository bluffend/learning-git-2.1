			<h1>DEEP PURPLE band - devKasia</h1>
  			<h2>Smoke on the water</h2>
  			<p>We all came out to <br>
  			Montreux On the Lake Geneva shoreline,<br>
  			To make records with the mobile.<br>
  			We didn't have much time.<br>
  			Frank Zappa and the Mothers<br>
  			Were at the best place around,<br>
  			But some stupid with a flare gun<br>
  			Burned the place to the ground.<br>
  			</p>
			<p>Smoke on the water and fire in the sky, <br> 
			Smoke on the water.<br><br> 
			They burned the gambling house,<br>
			It died with an awful sound.<br>
			And Funky Claude was running in and out.<br>
			Pulling kids out the ground,<br>
			When it all was over we had to find another place,<br>
			But Swiss time was running out.<br>
			It seemed that we would lose the race.<br><br> 
			Smoke on the water and fire in the sky,<br> 
			Smoke on the water.<br>
			<p>We ended up the Grand Hotel.<br>
			It was empty cold and bare,<br>
			But with the rolling truck <br>
			Stones thing just outside, yeah!<br>
			Making our music there.<br> 
			With a few red lights a few old beds<br>
			We made a place to sweat.<br> 
			No matter what we got out of this.<br> 
			I know, I know we'll never forget.<br><br> 
			Smoke on the water and fire in the sky,<br> 
			Smoke on the water.<br>
